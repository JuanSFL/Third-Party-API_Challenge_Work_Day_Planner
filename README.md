# Work Day Planner Built Using Third-Party APIs

## Description

This application was built using HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and Javascript for functionality with the aid of third party APIs.
The purpose of this application is to help the user organize their time by planning a structured work day with their tasks and planned times that they should be started and completed.

## User Instructions 

* The user will enter the application and view a empty planner displaying the normal work day hours (8:00am - 6:00pm).
* The user will pick a time which they would like to begin a task.
* The user will then write down the task in the desired time box
* Once the user has written their task down in their desired time block, they must click the time block's corresponding save button. This will allow the user to close their browser and reference the planner at a later time during the day.
* The task box will display a red color when it is time to begin a task and display a grey color when the time to start/complete the task has ended.
* If it is not yet time to start the task, the task box will display a green color indicating that the task is planned for later.
